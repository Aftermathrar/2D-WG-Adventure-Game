  text: '[]It''s mostly as it seems, although I agree there are a couple suspicious
    points. The academy regularly pulls some strings to grant exceptions to the normal
    recruitment process of the guild, but it''s strange that there hasn''t been more
    info out of Stonebanks.

    []Low-ranking dungeons usually have more information
    coming out of them, it''s strange to not know what monsters have been sighted.
    Given that the Earl isn''t concerned about the village, it''s probably pretty
    weak.'
