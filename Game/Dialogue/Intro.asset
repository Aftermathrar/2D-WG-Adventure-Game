  text: "    This discipline is focused on being a frontline soldier, able to sustain
    and mitigate damage while getting support from behind. Since your goal was to
    be a solo adventurer, you've mastered a number of offensive spells and how to
    overlay defensive buffs onto them. The result is that you're able attack fiercely
    and time your attacks in order to reflect any incoming damage.\n    The demonstration
    you'll be doing will be an overview of how each of your abilities work and how
    to overlap their buffs. Then you'll work with an instructor doing simple attacks
    to show students how the damage nullification and reflection works."

  text: "    The ones that prove worthwhile invariably come under the control of
    the adventurer's guild, which curates information, quests, and supplies to ensure
    the smooth and efficient harvest of the dungeons. \n    It's not all without
    incident, though. Outbreaks from previously undiscovered dungeons can take villages
    by surprise, threatening to wipe them off the map. Even catalogued dungeons will
    have deaths from unprepared or overconfident adventurers."

    the same time the graduating class is leaving. This gives each department an
    opportunity to demonstrate the merits of their program by having select upperclassmen
    show off what they've learned. You were chosen to display some of the possibilities

  text: "    It's the start of a new chapter in your life, the first where you'll
    truly be on your own. Growing up surrounded by swords and magic, you proved competent
    enough to board at a prominent magic university, grinding away with studies until
    learning a suite of spells that suit you. \n    Today is your final day, after
    which you've decided to travel and carve your own path with your skills. The
    continent is littered with dungeons, overlapped with human settlements that sprang
    up to harvest the myriad resources on offer inside. These dungeons vary in appearance
    and difficulty based on the region they appear in."
